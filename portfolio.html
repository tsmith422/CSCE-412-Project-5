                    <h1>Rev Bot</h1>
                    <p>I was tasked by the Texas Engineering Academies Student
                        Organization to create a Discord bot for automating role
                        assignments after becoming an officer. Despite my Python
                        knowledge, I had never created a Discord bot or worked
                        with an API, making this a great learning
                        opportunity.</p>
                    <p>The organization requires a one-time payment for
                        students to access important Discord channels, and
                        members who pay gain the "Verified" role. The bot
                        uses the Google Sheets API to automate role
                        assignments by verifying members' information from a
                        form saved on a spreadsheet.</p>
                    <p>This method allows real-time
                        updates and immediate verification, along with 24/7
                        uptime due to the process running on a rasbian
                        comparable microcomputer. While the bot
                        primarily handles new member authentication, I plan
                        to expand its functionality for other tasks and
                        ensure the code is understandable for future
                        officers.</p>

                    <h1>Wordle</h1>
                    <p>In my sophomore year of college, I created my first
                        visual interactive program using JavaFX and
                        SceneBuilder, which made the design process enjoyable
                        and straightforward. With my Java experience, I focused
                        on adding features and creating a visually appealing

                        game. </p>
                    <p>The project involved selecting random words
                        through Java File IO, using a complex data structure for
                        letter storage, and ensuring the application was
                        user-friendly. Additionally, I implemented player
                        statistics tracking, including wins/losses, number of
                        games played, and streaks, all accessible at any
                        time.</p>

                            TAMU Datathon</a>, my first-ever
                        datathon, where our team trained an AI model to predict
                        patient survival based on their condition. We worked
                        with a flawed dataset in CSV format, cleaned and
                        adjusted the data, and used recursive feature
                        elimination to identify key survival factors.</p>
                    <p>This enabled us to train the Keras Sequential Model for
                        predictions, which were then scored for accuracy.
                        Despite our code not being the most accurate, our
                        detailed writeup helped our team, consisting of Arul
                        Dhar, Bao Nguyen, and myself, to be selected as one of
                        the winners of the Datathon.</p>
