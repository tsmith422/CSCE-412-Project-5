                <h2>How it started</h2>
                <p>The first time I “programmed” was in elementary school, we
                    had a computer lab where we messed around with website
                    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>. I liked
                    playing games
                    growing up and realizing I
                    had the chance to try and make my own was exciting for
                    me!<br><br>

                    Further down the line, in my junior year of high school, I
                    finally took my first actual programming course; we learned
                    Java and I caught on quite quickly. My teacher saw this and,
                    by the end of the year, asked if I would be a part of the
                    <a href="https://www.uiltexas.org/" target="_blank">University
                        Interscholastic League (UIL)</a>.

            <div>
                <p>The following year I participated on our school’s Computer
                    Science team where we ranked first in our region and second
                    in our state; individually I placed 13th in our state.
                    Unfortunately, that was my senior year of high school so
                    that was the only year I participated in academic UIL;
                    however, it was an extremely fun and competitive challenge
                    that made my passion for programming flourish.</p>

                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>During my first year of college I took an Engineering
                    Computing course which taught me python, this was one of the
                    most interesting courses I have taken because the main focus
                    was working together with a group of people in order to
                    solve complex coding problems. The language itself came easy
                    to me but learning how to work with others, especially on a
                    project that we had to work on over the course of various
                    weeks, was extremely valuable.<br><br>

                    After my first year, I applied to be a computer science
                    major at Texas A&M University, College of Engineering. Since
                    I had a 4.0 GPA and my personal essays were strong enough, I
                    was admitted to the department of Computer Science for a CS
                    major! This was an extremely exciting part of my life
                    because I know that only a very small percentage of people
                    who apply to be a CS Major at A&M actually get in.

            <div>
                <p>During my second year, I spent two semesters taking the most
                    difficult computer science courses I have ever taken:
                    Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms, and
                    Computer Architecture. Before this, I was usually able to
                    get by on just the information from lectures alone; I rarely
                    had to sit down and study material. However, these courses
                    were much more difficult than I anticipated; there was
                    actually a time where I was at a failing grade in each of
                    these classes midway through each semester. Luckily, I was
                    able to pull back and manage high A’s in my Data Structs and
                    Computer Architecture courses, my Discrete Mathematics,
                    however, was only a high B. This semester taught me a lot
                    about what challenges I am going to face moving forward in
                    CS, but more importantly, it taught me how to properly study
                    and manage my time in general.</p>

                <h2>Extracurricular</h2>
                <p>In high school, I was part of the <a
                        href="https://www.nationalhonorsociety.org/" target="_blank">National
                        Honors Society</a> for
                    two years, volunteering over 100 hours for multiple
                    organizations. During my time in UIL Computer Science, my
                    mathematics teacher also asked me to be on the UIL
                    calculator team. The team as a whole did not make it very
                    far; however, individually I came 1st in our district and
                    5th place in our region. Unfortunately, only the top four
                    qualified for state so I was not able to compete at the
                    state level, but it was still a very fun experience for my
                    first year doing it.</p>

                <p>For my first year of college, I was admitted to the <a
                        href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/academies/index.html" target="_blank">Texas
                        A&M
                        Chevron Engineering Academies</a>. During this time,
                    former students of the Academies became ambassadors of the
                    program and would often talk to us current students about
                    what a positive thing the academies were for them. We were
                    able to ask them many questions about their experience in
                    the program, how the main campus is, and what they’re
                    currently doing and hope to do themselves. They were great
                    resources, as an incoming transition student, so I reached
                    out to them to see if I could become an ambassador myself. I
                    submitted my application and days later I actually received
                    a call asking if I would be willing to work on more projects
                    besides just being an ambassador.<br><br>

                    Due to my knowledge of computer science, they asked if I was
                    willing to become, not only an ambassador, but an officer
                    for the association. I would work on the communications
                    technologies within the organization as well as working
                    alongside the treasurer to create a fully automated
                    verification system the org could use for new members. This
                    seemed like an extremely daunting task and position to
                    immediately jump to, but I decided to just go for it because
                    I probably wouldn’t get another opportunity as good as this
                    one. If that project sounded interesting to you by the way,
                    I have it listed in my portfolio if you would like to check
                    it out.</p>

                <p>Can you create and html page and whenever you have to style
                    something with css, do it inside the html file:
                    The background color should be a very dark grey but not
                    black, all text should be a very light grey but not white.
                    The headers should be font inter and the body should be font
                    dm sans. Make sure all images have slightly curved edges and
