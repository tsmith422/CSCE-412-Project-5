                    <h2>Software Development</h2>
                    <p>I am quite interested in software development because it
                        allows me to create innovative solutions to real-world
                        problems. I enjoy the process of designing, coding, and
                        testing because the feeling of it working in the end
                        makes me know it was all worth it. Being able to build
                        applications that could help make my or anyone's job
                        even a bit easier is very rewarding.</p>

                    <p>Game development fascinates me because it combines
                        creativity with technical skills. I love taking the
                        programming skills I learn in the classroom and finally
                        being able to apply them to something visually
                        satisfying. Designing gameplay mechanics, creating
                        graphics, and coding the game logic is both complex and
                        exciting. I always find myself adding more features than
                        I need, but the feeling of wanting to add and do more is
                        why I enjoy doing it so much.</p>

                        interested me because it involves protecting systems and
                        data from malicious attacks. In an increasingly digital
                        world, ensuring the security and privacy of information
                        is crucial. I have always enjoyed problem solving and
                        puzzles so I was intrigued by the puzzle aspect of
                        identifying vulnerabilities, developing defense
                        strategies, and staying ahead of potential threats.
                        There are so many different aspects to Cybersecurity and
                        I look forward to finding the one that's most
                        interesting to me.</p>
